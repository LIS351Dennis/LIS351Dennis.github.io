	<p>My other hobbies that is not related to videogames are biking, weight lifting, running, eating, sleeping, watching anime, watching chinese/korean drama, and learning.</p>
	<p>Sometimes, I spend time with my friends. Either on discord playing videogames together or going outside, but currently we just stay home taking classes and playing videogames.</p>
	<h1>Here's a funny video of my friends fighting in highschool. The good old days.</h1>
